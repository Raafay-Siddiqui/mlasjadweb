## 💡 How It Works

### Subscription Flow:
```
Student clicks "Subscribe"
    ↓
Redirected to Stripe Checkout
    ↓
Completes payment
    ↓
Stripe sends webhook to /stripe/webhook
    ↓
System creates UserSubscription record
    ↓
Grants access to all courses in plan
    ↓
Upgrades user role to 'subscriber'
    ↓
Student can access all included courses ✅
```

### Payment Success:
```
Stripe charges card monthly
    ↓
Sends invoice.payment_succeeded webhook
    ↓
System updates subscription status to 'active'
    ↓
Updates billing dates
    ↓
Unlocks courses if previously locked ✅
```

### Payment Failure:
```
Stripe fails to charge card
    ↓
Sends invoice.payment_failed webhook
    ↓
System sets status to 'past_due'
    ↓
Activates 3-day grace period
    ↓
User can still access courses
    ↓
After grace period: courses locked but data saved
    ↓
User can resubscribe to restore access ✅
```

### Cancellation:
```
User cancels via billing portal
    ↓
Stripe sends customer.subscription.deleted webhook
    ↓
System locks course access (is_locked=True)
    ↓
All user data preserved (progress, quizzes, etc.)
    ↓
User can resubscribe anytime
    ↓
On resubscription: instant access restoration ✅
```
