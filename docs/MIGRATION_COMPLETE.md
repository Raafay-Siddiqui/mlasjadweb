# ✅ Database Migration Complete

## What Was Done

The database has been successfully migrated to support the new subscription system.

### Changes Applied:

1. **✅ Added to `course_access` table:**
   - `is_locked` (BOOLEAN) - For locking access while retaining data
   - `progress` (REAL) - For tracking user progress

2. **✅ Created new tables:**
   - `subscription_plan` - Stores subscription plan definitions
   - `user_subscription` - Tracks user subscriptions

## Database Status

All required tables and columns are now in place. The application should run without errors.

## Next Steps

### To Start Using Subscriptions:

1. **Restart your Flask application** (if running)
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
   python3 website.py
   ```

2. **Access the admin panel** at `/admin/subscriptions`
   - Login as an admin user
   - Create your first subscription plan

3. **Configure Stripe** (see SUBSCRIPTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md for details)
   - Set up webhook endpoint
   - Enable Customer Portal
   - Add webhook events

4. **Create templates** (5 templates needed)
   - `templates/subscription_plans.html`
   - `templates/my_subscription.html`
   - `templates/subscription_success.html`
   - `templates/subscription_cancel.html`
   - `templates/admin_subscriptions.html`

## Migration Script

The migration script `migrate_subscription_columns.py` has been created and successfully executed.

**This script is idempotent** - it can be run multiple times safely. It will only apply migrations that haven't been applied yet.

## Testing

You can verify the migration worked by:

1. Starting the Flask app - it should load without errors
2. Navigating to any course page - CourseAccess queries should work
3. Checking that the `/admin/subscriptions` route exists (once you create the template)

## Rollback (if needed)

To rollback the migration (remove subscription support):

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('instance/site.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Remove added columns (SQLite doesn't support DROP COLUMN easily)
# You'd need to recreate the table

# Drop subscription tables
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_subscription')
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS subscription_plan')

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `website.py` - Added subscription models, routes, and logic
- `stripe_helpers.py` - Added subscription Stripe functions
- `instance/site.db` - Database schema updated

### Created:
- `migrate_subscription_columns.py` - Migration script
- `SUBSCRIPTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full documentation
- `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - This file

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Flask error logs
2. Verify all columns exist: Run the verification script in `migrate_subscription_columns.py`
3. Ensure Stripe keys are configured in `.env`
4. Check that webhook secret is set

## Success Indicators

✅ Flask app starts without database errors
✅ Course pages load correctly
✅ CourseAccess queries execute successfully
✅ New subscription tables are queryable
✅ Admin can access subscription routes
