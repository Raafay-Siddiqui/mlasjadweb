# Stripe Payment Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Stripe payments for Al-Baqi Academy courses.

## Prerequisites

- A Stripe account (sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com))
- Access to your Stripe Dashboard
- Your application running on a publicly accessible domain (for webhooks)

## Step 1: Get Your Stripe API Keys

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Click on **Developers** ‚Üí **API keys**
3. You'll see two types of keys:
   - **Test keys** (for testing): `sk_test_...` and `pk_test_...`
   - **Live keys** (for production): `sk_live_...` and `pk_live_...`

4. Start with **test mode** keys for development

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit your `.env` file and add your Stripe keys:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51ABC...xyz
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51ABC...xyz
   ```

## Step 3: Set Up Stripe Webhook

Webhooks allow Stripe to notify your application when a payment is completed.

### Local Development (using Stripe CLI)

1. Install Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

   # On other systems, visit: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
   ```

2. Login to Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. Forward webhook events to your local server:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5005/stripe/webhook
   ```

4. Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_...`) and add it to your `.env`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_abc123...
   ```

### Production (using Stripe Dashboard)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com) ‚Üí **Developers** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. Enter your webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/stripe/webhook`
4. Select events to listen for:
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed`
5. Click **Add endpoint**
6. Copy the **Signing secret** and add it to your production `.env` file

## Step 4: Set Course Pricing

1. Login to your admin panel
2. Go to **Manage Courses**
3. Edit a course and set a price (e.g., `29.99`)
4. Save the course
5. Click **üîÑ Sync with Stripe** button to create the product in Stripe

## Step 5: Testing Payments

### Test Card Numbers

Use these test card numbers in Stripe test mode:

| Card Number         | Result                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Successful payment        |
| 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Card declined             |
| 4000 0025 0000 3155 | Requires authentication   |

- **Expiry**: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
- **CVC**: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
- **ZIP**: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)

### Testing the Flow

1. **Browse to homepage** and find a paid course
2. **Click "Purchase Course"** (you'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout)
3. **Enter test card details** (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242)
4. **Complete the payment**
5. **Verify access**: You should be redirected to the success page and have access to the course

## Step 6: Verify Integration

### Check Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com) ‚Üí **Payments**
2. You should see your test payment
3. Click on the payment to see details

### Check Database

1. Check the `course_access` table in your database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM course_access WHERE access_type = 'purchased';
   ```
2. You should see a record with:
   - `user_id`: The user who purchased
   - `course_id`: The purchased course
   - `stripe_payment_intent_id`: Stripe payment reference
   - `amount_paid`: The amount paid

### Test Course Access

1. Login with the user who made the purchase
2. Go to "My Courses"
3. The purchased course should show "‚úÖ Enrolled" or "Continue Learning"
4. You should be able to access all course materials

## Step 7: Going Live

When ready for production:

1. **Switch to live mode** in Stripe Dashboard
2. Get your **live API keys**: `sk_live_...` and `pk_live_...`
3. Update your production `.env` file with live keys
4. **Create production webhook**:
   - URL: `https://yourdomain.com/stripe/webhook`
   - Event: `checkout.session.completed`
   - Get the signing secret and update `.env`
5. **Test with real card** (use a small amount first!)
6. **Monitor payments** in Stripe Dashboard

## Currency Settings

By default, the integration uses **GBP (¬£)**. To change the currency:

1. Edit `stripe_helpers.py`
2. Find the line: `currency='gbp'`
3. Change to your preferred currency code:
   - `'usd'` for US Dollars
   - `'eur'` for Euros
   - `'cad'` for Canadian Dollars
   - etc.

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Keep your Stripe secret key confidential
- Use webhook signature verification (already implemented)
- Use HTTPS in production
- Monitor Stripe Dashboard for suspicious activity
- Test thoroughly in test mode before going live

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Commit `.env` file to version control
- Share your secret keys publicly
- Skip webhook verification
- Grant course access without webhook confirmation

## Troubleshooting

### "Payment system error"
- Check that your Stripe keys are correct in `.env`
- Verify the course has been synced with Stripe (click "üîÑ Sync with Stripe")
- Check application logs for detailed error messages

### "Webhook signature verification failed"
- Ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly
- In local development, make sure Stripe CLI is running
- In production, verify the webhook endpoint URL is correct

### Course access not granted after payment
- Check webhook is configured and receiving events
- View Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Events to see if webhook was called
- Check application logs for webhook processing errors
- Verify the webhook endpoint is publicly accessible (not behind authentication)
